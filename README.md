> _Note_: Unlike [HackKit](https://github.com/acmutsa/hackkit) and [ClubKit](https://github.com/acmutsa/clubkit), O is maintained primarily for internal use by ACM UTSA. The repository is able to be deployed however and used as reference! While we cannot guarantee support, if you are looking to deploy O for your orgainzation feel free to join our [Discord](https://go.acmutsa.org/projects-discord) to chat.

## About

O is a smorgasbord of internal tools that is used across ACM, including its suborgs and hackathons. It supports (or plans to support) tooling for:

- Meetings
- Officer Directory
- Finances
- Go Links
- Inventory
- _and more!_

We also use software such as Google Workspace, Notion, and Slack with which O works in tandem.

## Contributing

Unlike with other ACM OSS software, O generally is only contributed to by internal members. If you would like to join us, feel free to join the [Discord](https://go.acmutsa.org/projects-discord)!
